## Description deliverable

### Elevator pitch

Imagine a game where your choices lead to actual consequences. Those choices would be reflected as you progressed in the world, allowing you to progess towards victory, or death. The purpose of the game would be for players to join together to save the world that is in peril. To save your progress, you would be able to log in and be able to see highscores of all the players in the world!
